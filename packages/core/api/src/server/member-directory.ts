// MemberDirectory — the ONE shared READ seam over "who belongs to this org".
//
// Sits beside `IdentityProvider` (./identity.ts) as the second provider-neutral
// auth surface. `IdentityProvider` answers "who is calling"; this answers "who
// is a member, with what role and status" — the question every member list,
// admin users page, seat count, and per-request membership check asks. Cloud
// (WorkOS) implements it over a LOCAL mirror of WorkOS users + memberships
// (fed by login, write-through, and the WorkOS Events API); self-host (Better
// Auth) implements it over its own `member` + `user` tables. Shared code
// consumes only this tag and never learns which host it is on.
//
// Read-only by design. Writes stay host-specific: cloud writes go to WorkOS
// and are mirrored back; self-host writes go through Better Auth's org plugin.
// Invitations are NOT members and are not reported here.
