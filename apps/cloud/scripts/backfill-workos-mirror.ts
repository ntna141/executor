// One-off data backfill: fill the membership mirror (`accounts` profile

//
//   bun run db:backfill-workos-mirror:prod   # op run --env-file=.env.production
//   bun run db:backfill-workos-mirror:dev    # against the local PGlite dev db
//
// For each live row in `organizations`: list EVERY membership WorkOS holds
// for it (active, pending, and inactive — a listing that skipped inactive
// ones would have the scan tombstone them, see `auth/workos-mirror-backfill.ts`),
// fetch each member's user (concurrency 5), and apply the listing in one
// transaction through the same guarded store the request path
// uses (`auth/workos-mirror-store.ts`): upsert user + membership, tombstone
// any mirrored membership of that org WorkOS no longer lists, and mark the
// org backfilled (`organizations.backfilled_at`) — the per-org mark the seat
// gates check before trusting a count from the mirror; an org left unmarked
// is scanned on demand the first time its seats are counted. Idempotent —
// the upserts refuse anything older than the stored WorkOS `updatedAt`, so
// re-running is safe, never rewinds a fresher row, and repairs a stale one;
// and a listing older than one already applied (two runs overlapping) is
// refused whole, so it cannot resurrect a membership the later listing found
// gone. Pass --dry-run to read and count without writing.
//
// DEPLOY ORDER: run this against production BEFORE deploying the builds that
// reconcile from the Events API and read seat counts from the mirror, so no
// request pays for an on-demand scan. The FIRST completed run records the
// events replay boundary (the reconciler's first run reads from it; without
// one it waits); later runs keep it, since only the events stream covers the
// org renames and user deletions between two runs. A run that fails part-way
// keeps the marks of the orgs it finished, records no boundary, and is safe
// to repeat. Verify the printed membership count against the WorkOS
// dashboard.
