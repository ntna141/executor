// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The membership mirror's FEEDERS, end to end through the code that runs in
// production, against the real PGlite Postgres every cloud unit test runs on
// (scripts/test-globalsetup.ts). WorkOS is a fake `WorkOSClient` (the
// emulator has no list-users / events routes); the mirror, the user store,
// and the directory read are the live layers over `DbService.Live`.
//
// What this pins:
//   - the login callback records the signed-in user and EVERY membership
//     WorkOS lists (active and pending), with the org row minted so the FK
//     holds — from the one membership list it already fetches
//   - the callback picks the landing org from that same list: a returnTo
//     slug or last-org cookie lands only in an ACTIVE membership, an unknown
//     or pending one falls through
//   - `removeMember` tombstones the mirror row after the WorkOS delete,
//     stamped with the membership's last WorkOS state (never a local clock),
//     so a replay of the membership as it was before the delete cannot
//     restore it while a replacement WorkOS created meanwhile is accepted
//   - `updateMemberRole` writes the role WorkOS returned
//   - the backfill mirrors every org's members and counts what it wrote,
//     writes nothing on a dry run, converges on a re-run, tombstones a
//     membership WorkOS no longer lists — but never one written after its
//     listing was taken — marks each org backfilled as of its listing, and
//     records the events replay boundary only when it completes and only
//     ONCE: a run that fails part-way keeps the marks of the orgs it
//     finished and records no boundary, and a later completed run keeps the
//     first boundary (the org renames and user deletions between two runs
//     are the events stream's to replay)
//   - two scans of one org that overlap cannot resurrect a membership: a scan
//     that listed it, stalled, and resumed after a later listing (which no
//     longer had it) was applied is refused whole
//   - a login whose membership list was fetched BEFORE the org was purged and
//     written after cannot re-mint the org or its membership, one fetched
//     before a rename cannot revert the rename, and one fetched before a
//     revocation the backfill has since scanned cannot reinstate the
//     membership
