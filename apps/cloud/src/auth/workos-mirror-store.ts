// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The membership mirror's WRITE store — the Drizzle queries behind
// `WorkOsMirror`, plus the converters from WorkOS SDK payloads to mirror rows.
//
// Kept free of `cloudflare:workers` (no `DbService`, no `env`) so the one-off
// backfill (`scripts/backfill-workos-mirror.ts`) can run the SAME upserts over
// a plain postgres.js connection under bun. The request-scoped service that
// wraps this store is `workos-mirror.ts`.
//
// Every write is idempotent and out-of-order safe. Both upserts carry the
// WorkOS `updatedAt` of their payload and refuse to overwrite a row whose
// stored `workos_updated_at` is newer, so a replayed or late-arriving event
// can never regress the mirror. A delete never drops the row: it TOMBSTONES
// it (`status = 'inactive'`, `deleted_at` set) — and INSERTS the tombstone
// when the row is not there yet — so a feeder that fetched the membership
// before the deletion and writes it after (a login, the backfill) finds the
// tombstone instead of reinstating access. The tombstone is protected by
// IDENTITY, not by time: WorkOS never reuses a deleted `om_…` id, so a
// payload naming the tombstoned id is refused whatever it is stamped — a
// role change issued before the removal and delivered after it is stamped
// NEWER than the row and would beat any timestamp guard — while a payload
// naming a DIFFERENT id for the same (account, organization) is the member
// re-added in WorkOS, a replacement, and takes the row over under the usual
// `updatedAt` rule (WorkOS creates it after the old one is deleted, so it is
// always the newer). A tombstone keeps the stamp the row holds, the deleted
// membership's last reported state — never a local clock: read after WorkOS
// answered, it could post-date a replacement created meanwhile and refuse
// it for good. `deleted_at` is the deletion instant when the caller holds
// one (an event's `createdAt`, a scan's listing time) and `now()` otherwise;
// it records WHEN, it orders nothing. A membership WorkOS merely
// deactivated (`status = 'inactive'`, no `deleted_at`) is not a tombstone:
// WorkOS can reactivate it under the same id, and the `updatedAt` rule
// orders that as any other update. The row tombstone can only speak for the
// id the row happens to hold, so every delete ALSO records the deleted id in
// `membership_tombstones`, a ledger keyed by the WorkOS id alone, and every
// membership write consults it first: that covers the case the row cannot —
// membership A replaced by B in WorkOS before the mirror saw either, B then
// deleted. The delete finds a row holding A (not B's to tombstone) and would
// otherwise leave nothing behind; a later scan that still lists B would then
// insert it live, stamped after A and under another id, exactly what the row
// guard lets through. With the ledger the delete is recorded whatever the
// row holds, and B's payload is refused by identity. A scan records the ids
// it tombstones the same way. A deleted USER is protected by identity
// too: `deleteUser` leaves the account row behind as a tombstone (profile
// cleared, stamped with the deletion), and no membership naming that account
// is written again, however the payload is stamped — WorkOS never reuses a
// user id, and a membership the mirror had not seen has no row of its own
// for a guard to refuse the insert against. The cursor advances only by
// compare-and-set, so two reconciler runs cannot both own the stream.
//
// A backfill SCAN of one organization (its full membership listing, taken
// at one instant) is applied in ONE transaction that first compare-and-sets
// the organization's `backfilled_at` to the listing's instant
// (`applyOrganizationScan`): the row stays locked until commit, so two
// overlapping scans serialize on it, and the one whose listing is older
// than the recorded one writes NOTHING. The `updatedAt` guard alone cannot
// order two scans: a scan that listed a membership, stalled, and resumed
// after a later scan had found it gone would insert it live — the later scan
// left no tombstone, because the row was not there to tombstone. For the
// same reason every OTHER membership write is ordered against the scan too:
// a payload stamped before the organization's `backfilled_at` is refused
// unless the row already holds it — judged inside the write's own
// transaction, reading the organization row `FOR SHARE`, so a write that
// races a scan waits for the scan's commit and sees the mark it set, and
// never inserts a membership the scan has just proved revoked. A completed
// scan is the full listing as
// of that instant, so a membership it did not contain but an older payload
// still names (a login whose list was fetched before the revocation and
// written after the scan) was revoked before the scan — and that revocation
// predates the events replay boundary, so nothing would ever tombstone the
// reinstated row. The scan's own writes are the one exception: they are the
// listing that sets the mark.
//
// The events replay boundary (`workos_sync.range_start`) is written ONCE, by
// the first completed backfill, and never advanced: a later backfill
// refreshes memberships only, so an organization rename or user deletion
// between two runs is covered by the events stream alone, and moving the
// boundary past it would skip it for good.
