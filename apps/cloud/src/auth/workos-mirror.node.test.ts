// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The cloud membership mirror: `WorkOsMirror` (writes) + the cloud
// `MemberDirectory` (reads), against the real PGlite Postgres every cloud
// unit test runs on (scripts/test-globalsetup.ts), through the same
// `DbService.Live` the request path uses.
//
// What this pins:
//   - an older WorkOS payload never overwrites a newer row (replay-safe)
//   - a delete tombstones the row (inactive, `deleted_at` set) by IDENTITY:
//     no payload naming the deleted membership id ever reactivates it,
//     however it is stamped — not a stale one, not one stamped after the
//     removal — while a replacement under a NEW id takes the row over live;
//     every default read treats the tombstone as no membership
//   - a membership WorkOS merely deactivated (inactive, no `deleted_at`)
//     reactivates under the same id like any other update
//   - a delete of a membership or user the mirror has not seen yet leaves
//     the tombstone behind, so the backfill's older payload cannot insert
//     the row live afterwards
//   - a delete of a membership id the row does NOT hold (the member's row
//     still carries the id it was replaced from) is recorded all the same,
//     so a later, newer payload of the deleted id cannot take the row over
//   - a deleted user takes no membership at all, however the payload is
//     stamped: the account tombstone refuses the insert by identity — and a
//     membership write racing the deletion waits for its commit and sees
//     the tombstone, never inserting a live membership for a deleted user
//   - a delete with no WorkOS instant keeps the row's own WorkOS stamp, so
//     a replacement membership WorkOS created meanwhile is not refused,
//     while the removed membership's own payload still is
//   - the cursor advances only by compare-and-set (one owner per stream)
//   - a backfill scan is applied only if its listing is newer than the one
//     already applied to the organization (one owner per listing instant),
//     so an older listing cannot insert a membership the newer one lacked;
//     a deleted organization takes no scan
//   - a membership payload stamped before the organization's last scan is
//     refused (a login list fetched before a revocation the scan already
//     applied cannot reinstate it); one stamped at or after it is written —
//     and a write racing a scan waits for the scan's commit and sees its
//     mark, so it cannot insert a membership the scan just proved revoked
//   - the events replay boundary is recorded once and never advanced
//   - `members` searches email AND name case-insensitively, pages stably
//   - `findByEmail` ignores the casing WorkOS stored
//   - a membership arriving before its user still holds (FK via ensureAccount)
