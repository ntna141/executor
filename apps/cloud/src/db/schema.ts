// AuthKit owns the canonical user/membership data. We mirror it locally:
//
//   - `accounts`       — login identity + profile (foreign key anchor for
//                        created_by, etc.; email/name/avatar for member lists)
//   - `organizations`  — billing entity, scoping root for all domain data
//   - `memberships`    — which accounts belong to which organizations, with
//                        the WorkOS role and status
//   - `workos_sync`    — the WorkOS Events API cursor the reconciler resumes
//                        from, and the replay boundary the one-off backfill
//                        records
//
// The mirror is fed by login (the callback has the user + memberships in
// hand), write-through on every Executor-initiated change, and the WorkOS
// Events API (dashboard-side changes). It is the read path for membership and
// member lists — WorkOS is a write target and an event source, never a
// per-request read. Invitations are NOT mirrored; they stay live in WorkOS.
//
// `workos_updated_at` on `accounts` and `memberships` is the WorkOS
// `updatedAt` of the payload that last wrote the row. Every upsert is guarded
// on it, so feeders can be replayed and reordered without an older payload
// clobbering a newer one.
