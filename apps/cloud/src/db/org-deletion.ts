// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Organization data purge — removes every local trace of an org in one txn
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Identity (accounts/organizations/memberships) and executor tenant data
// (integrations, connections, tools, secrets, ...) share ONE Postgres database
// (`combinedSchema` in `db.ts`), so deleting an org is a single transaction
// here rather than a fan-out across stores. Tenant rows carry the org id in a
// `tenant` column; secrets/tokens live in `blob`, namespaced by owner.
//
// External side effects (the WorkOS org, the Autumn customer) are NOT touched
// here — the caller (auth handler) sequences those around this purge.
//
// The `organizations` row itself is NOT deleted: it stays as a TOMBSTONE,
// marked `deleted_at`, with its memberships removed. The membership mirror's
// feeders write whatever WorkOS payload they hold — a login that fetched its
// membership list before the deletion can write it after this purge — and
// the tombstone is what makes those writes refuse: `upsertOrganization`
// never re-mints or renames a marked organization, and the mirror never
// inserts a membership of one. Without it the login would insert a fresh,
// live organization row plus an active membership, and the deleted
// organization would authorize again.
