## What Executor is

Executor is an open-source integration layer for AI agents. Configure every
integration once (MCP servers, OpenAPI specs, GraphQL APIs, custom sources)
with authentication and per-tool policies, then use that one catalog from any
MCP-compatible agent.

Wiring tools to agents is fiddly, per-client, and easy to get wrong. Executor
makes every tool, from any protocol, look the same: one name, one input schema,
one output schema, so any agent can call any of them the same way.

Connect everything you use and Executor still shows the model a single tool. It
searches your catalog and loads a tool's schema only when the code actually
calls it, so the prompt never balloons.

## How it works

- **Integration** — anything you add: an MCP server, an OpenAPI spec, a GraphQL
  API, or a Google Discovery document.
- **Connection** — one configured (optionally authenticated) instance of an
  integration. An integration can have many connections.
- **Policy** — whether each tool is always allowed, requires approval, or is
  blocked. Policies start from a sensible default derived from the imported
  spec (for example, GET requests on an OpenAPI spec are allowed by default).

Then use it from any MCP-compatible agent: one catalog of tools, shared across
every client.

## What you get

## Safe by default

- Policies come from the source: GET versus DELETE for OpenAPI, destructiveHint for MCP, mutations for GraphQL. Agents run the safe calls on their own and ask before the rest.
- Secrets never reach the model: calls run in an isolated JavaScript sandbox and credentials are attached host-side at call time.
- Set up once, whole team has it: admins add workspace connections everyone shares, individuals add their own, and a tool can be blocked for the whole workspace.
- Open source, so you can check: Cloud stores credentials in WorkOS Vault; local and self-hosted keep them on your machine or in 1Password. Source: ${GITHUB_URL}

## Ways to run it

All forms expose the same functionality, packaged differently.

### Cloud

Hosted Executor. Auth, sync, policies, and your whole team online in five
minutes. Free tier to start: https://executor.sh/cloud

### Desktop

A desktop app for Mac, Windows, and Linux that runs entirely on your machine.
Your integrations, credentials, and sessions never leave the device.

Downloads follow the latest GitHub release:

\`${GITHUB_URL}/releases/latest/download/executor-desktop-<platform>\`

## What people say

Mostly that they stopped copying API keys into five different agents.
