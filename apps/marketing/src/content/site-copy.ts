Executor is an open source integration layer for AI agents: one place to configure every integration (MCP servers, OpenAPI specs, GraphQL APIs) and connect to them over MCP.

Start by helping me pick the right form to run it in. Chat with me about it rather than jumping straight to a yes/no question, and recommend one. If I just want the fastest path, suggest Executor Cloud (free tier, nothing to install). All forms expose the same functionality, just packaged differently:

Local (everything stays on my machine):
- Desktop app: a desktop app for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Best for a regular desktop environment.
- CLI (\`executor\`): best for a headless or server environment.
Both run a local HTTP server as a background service that any MCP client can connect to.

Hosted (use it from multiple agents, including cloud ones, with nothing running locally):
- Executor Cloud: hosted, generous free tier, sign in and start immediately.
- Self-hosted: a Docker image.

How to think about it:
- Want all your data on your own machine? Go local: the desktop app for a regular environment, the CLI for a headless one.
- Want to use it from multiple agents (including cloud agents like ChatGPT), or not run anything locally? Go hosted: Executor Cloud is the fastest start; the self-hosted Docker version gives you full control.

Terms you'll come across:
- Integration: anything you add (an MCP server, an OpenAPI spec, a GraphQL API).
- Connection: one configured instance of an integration. An integration can have many connections, and a connection doesn't have to be authenticated.
- Policy: whether each tool is always allowed, requires approval, or is blocked. Policies start from a sensible default derived from the imported spec (for example, GET requests on an OpenAPI spec are allowed by default).

Once you know which form I want:
1. Walk me through installing it.
2. Connect Executor to you over MCP. Most MCP clients only load servers at startup, so after adding it I may need to restart the client or open a new chat before the Executor tools appear. Tell me if that's needed and wait for me to do it before continuing.
3. Once the tools are available, help me add my first integration and get one tool working end to end.
